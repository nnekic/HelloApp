# HelloApp

## Description

On the login page you can see simple mock login. Type your username and password, after clicking on the Login button the prompt will come up and greet you on your local language.  
I used 2 APIs. First one is api.ipify.org and it is used to get user's public IP address which will be used by the second API (hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev) to find out user's geolocation.  
Use Logout button to clear out username and password text fields.
